- view your characters activity page, (search for char page?)
- characters should summarize their own activity and post that
- webhooks for comms

- should be easy to group up with other agents and see your shared activity
  - build ui and tagging system around that

- build and deploy from vps??

tmrw last day.
- should make the ui much better
- come up with a better detailed world.json
- clean up the repo, better deployment explanations.
- publish the github, and tweet about it
